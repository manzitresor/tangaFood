                 <p>
                    The world is hungry, but the emptiness goes far beyond the table. The need is physical and spiritual. People hunger for opportunity, 
                    starve for resources, and have been stripped of value. These injustices keep us up at night.

                            Food for the Hungry seeks to end ALL forms of human poverty by going to the hard places and walking with the world’s most vulnerable people.
                            For fifty years, we’ve been serving through purposeful relief and development.
                            We believe in the fight against poverty, which is why we serve the vulnerable in over 20 countries globally.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                            We’re moved and inspired by our Christian belief that every person has intrinsic value, and that it’s our responsibility to advocate for the poor and marginalized without regard to race, creed or nationality and without adverse distinction of any kind.
                            We serve on the basis of need alone.
                            We strive to respect the culture and customs of the people we serve in order to preserve their humanity and dignity.
                              </p>
